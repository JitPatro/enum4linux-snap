# The [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) snap

Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to enum.exe formerly available from www.bindview.com.

This repo provides the necessary files to create a snap package for [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux). It'll work on Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and all other major linux distributions that have [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) installed.
